    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Manti is a type of dumpling popular in most Turkic cuisines, as well as in the cuisines of the South Caucasus and Balkans, Central Asia, Afghanistan and Chinese Muslims.[1] Manti are also consumed throughout Russia and other post-Soviet countries, where the dish spread from the Central Asian republics.</p>

    <p>The name, depending on the language, can refer to a single dumpling or to more than one dumpling at a time; in English, it is often used as both a singular and plural form.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 egg (s)</li>
        <li>400 ml water</li>
        <li>1 kg flour</li>
        <li>1 kg minced meat, mixed</li>
        <li>5 onion (s)</li>
        <li>80 g butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the eggs, water and flour into a batter. Gradually add the flour until the dough becomes supple and no longer sticks to your hands. Knead the dough well. It should be elastic so that it can be rolled out easily. Cover the dough and let it rest for about an hour at room temperature.</li>
        <li>Cut the onions into fine strips (do not chop up!). Mix the minced meat and onions and season well with salt and pepper. Make sure to knead the filling well with your hands! This is the only way that the onion juice mixes best with the meat. That makes the filling soft and juicy.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough and cut it out with a round shape (diameter 10-12 cm). Put a little meat filling on each of the dough circles and place a piece of butter on each. To form manti, first fold up the dough on both sides and glue it together in the middle over a length of approx. 3 cm, then fold up the ends and connect across the middle part (T-shaped). Finally, press the ends together firmly. Brush the bottom of the steamer with oil to prevent the manti from sticking to it. Spread the manti on the bases and steam for about 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve the manti immediately and serve with sour cream and possibly ketchup.</li>
    </ol>
