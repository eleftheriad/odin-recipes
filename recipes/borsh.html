    <h1>Borsh</h1>
    <img src="../images/borsh.png">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Borscht is a sour soup common in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. Depending on the recipe, borscht may include meat or fish, or be purely vegetarian; it may be served either hot or cold, and it may range from a hearty one-pot meal to a clear broth or a smooth drink. It is often served with smetana or sour cream, hard-boiled eggs or potatoes, but there exists an ample choice of more involved garnishes and side dishes, such as uszka or pampushky, that can be served with the soup.</p>
    <p>Its popularity has spread throughout Eastern Europe and – by way of migration away from the Russian Empire – to other continents. </p>
