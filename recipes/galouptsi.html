    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>ts pronounced “golubtsy”or “goloobsti.” It’s also known as stuffed cabbage, but not like any stuffed cabbage you’ve ever had. This is something every Russian and Ukrainian family makes. This is my Mama-in-law’s recipe. It tastes just like my moms; PERFECT!!</p>
    <p>Golubtsi take a lot of time if you are making the full recipe (2 hours to prep and stuff the cabbage, then 1 to 2 hours to cook). By “family size,” I mean; Mom, Dad and 12 kids (That many kids is not uncommon in the land of Ukraine – in fact, I can name off several families that have 10 or more kids). My point is, it makes a full pot.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 cups medium grain cooked white rice</li>
        <li>2 Medium Cabbages</li>
        <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>1 pound ground turkey</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>6 medium carrots</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse 2 cups white rice and cook in 3 1/2 cups water with 2 Tbsp olive oil and 1 tsp salt. Cover and simmer for about 20 minutes, or until all the water is absorbed. Or do the same thing in a rice maker.</li>
        <li>Fill 2/3 of  large soup pot with water. Bring to a boil. Add 1/2 Tbsp salt and 4 Tbsp vinegar.</li>
        <li>Peal and discard the top two leaves from each cabbage. Use a knife to cut out the core of each cabbage (see picture). Put first cabbage in water, cork down, for about 5 minutes, then rotate and continue cooking another 5-6 min. You will pull off leaves as they begin to soften.</li>
    </ol>
